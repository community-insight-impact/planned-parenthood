Rhode Island’s Sex Education Snapshot
In 2019, Representative Marcia Ranglin-Vassell, Representative Susan Donovan, and Representative Teresa Tanzi introduced House Bill 5046 in an effort to require students to receive instruction on safe relationship behavior and training on the prevention of relationship abuse, sexual violence, and sexual harassment. While the bill was ultimately unsuccessful, advocates are continuing to work to advance sex education statewide.
Most recently in 2021, these efforts culminated in the enactment of House Bill 6469, introduced by Representative Karen Alzate, which expands the scope of dating violence education by amending the definition of dating violence and also requires each school to collect data on student misconduct that is considered dating violence. Rhode Island also enacted House Bill 5083, introduced by Representative Carol McEntee, which requires all public schools to provide students with menstrual products at no cost.
In 2018, legislators successfully passed House Bill 7044 to permit instruction on consent in sex education in secondary schools. Rhode Island has a long history of taking incremental steps to advance sex education, beginning in 2006 when the Rhode Island Department of Education stated that schools should not administer abstinence-only curriculum provided by Heritage Rhode Island (which closed a year later). This curriculum was reported to include inaccurate information about STDs and stigmatizing instruction directed towards LGBTQ individuals and women.
Sex education in Rhode Island is required to include instruction on a variety of topics including reproduction, abstinence, dating and dating violence, marriage, and parenthood, as well as information about STDs, sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Despite these requirements, curriculum is not mandated to be comprehensive. The lack of such requirements present further challenges in ensuring that low income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine if sex education is required to be comprehensive, and if not, what topics are missing from instruction. This may include topics such as consent, healthy relationships, and contraceptive options, or ensuring curriculum is culturally responsive to the needs of young people of color. They can then vocalize the important need for advancing sex education requirements in their community. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for ensuring schools are supported in implementing comprehensive sex education statewide. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Rhode Island schools are required by Rhode Island General Laws §§ 16-1-5, 16-22-17 and 16-22-18 to provide “accurate information and instruction on [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] AIDS transmission and prevention.” Schools must also teach “the responsibilities of family membership and adulthood, including issues related to reproduction, abstinence, dating and dating violence, marriage, and parenthood, as well as information about sexually transmitted diseases [STDs], sexuality, and sexual orientation.” These classes must stress “abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred means of prevention as a basic education program requirement.”
Parents must be notified of sex education classes and may view the curriculum by submitting a written request. Students may be removed from instruction by written notification from the parent to the principal. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
Rhode Island provides three resources, Rules and Regulations for School Health Programs, Comprehensive Health Instructional Outcomes, and the Health Education Framework, all of which provide curricula development requirements that sex education instruction must be aligned to. “Sexuality and Family Life” represents its own instructional outcome, with components such as “us[ing] strategies that improve or maintain sexual health,” and requires discussion of “public health policies, government regulations, health promotion, and disease prevention, [including] issues such as abortion/contraception.”
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Rhode Island’s 2021 session convened January 5, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Rhode Island School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.
