Michigan’s Sex Education Snapshot
Michigan advocates have worked tirelessly to advance sex education. Their most recent efforts culminated in the introduction of Senate Bill 270, introduced by Senator Curtis Hertel in 2019. Although unsuccessful, the bill sought to mandate sex education curriculum to include instruction on consent, sexual violence, and dating violence. Also unsuccessful, House Bill 5499 sought to require sex education to be age appropriate, medically accurate, and objective. It also sought to require all materials to be appropriate for students regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, students with disabilities, and English language learners. It would have required curriculum to include instruction on sexual orientation, gender identity, all outcomes of pregnancy including abortion, and sexual abuse. Further, curriculum must not teach or promote religious doctrine.  In addition to these progressive efforts, Senate Bill 600, introduced by Senator Jon Bumstead and also unsuccessful, sought to remove health and physical education as a graduation requirement. Advocates worry that if successful, the implementation of this policy would result in even fewer schools opting to provide sex education under the already regulated curriculum requirements.
In light of the coronavirus pandemic, advocates have shifted their efforts to advance sex education online. There have been reports that sex education is now even less of a priority than it has been previously given the constraints virtual learning has presented. Sex education was suspended from the 2019-2020 health education requirements due to the virus, but resumed in the fall of 2020. Despite this, advocates are unsure of if and how students are currently receiving sex education. Advocates are working to reintroduce sex education that was halted last session due to the pandemic.
Michigan advocates have faced significant setbacks in recent years in their efforts to advance access to reproductive health information. In 2016, the 2016 School Aid Act went into effect and included a provision that introduced penalties for any public school employees that assist students in accessing abortion care. This provision furthered the inability for teachers to discuss abortion as a valid outcome of pregnancy, following the passage of a 2004 regulation that prohibits teachers from discussing abortion as a method of reproductive health. In response, districts including the East Lansing Public School district publicly condemned the 2016 resolution. Affirming abortion as a valid outcome of pregnancy is a critical topic for inclusion within comprehensive sex education programs. Limiting access to abortion further inhibits the ability of young people to make informed decisions about their health and future.
On the local level, few legislative advancements have occurred. The city of Allendale received pushback in 2019 after parents advocated for sex education curriculum to be science-based and inclusive of topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity. After intense debate largely dominated by community members opposed to updating the curriculum, the school district removed all mention of sexual orientation and gender identity from course materials regardless of the subject.
However, some districts are beginning to see incremental changes toward advancing sex education. In 2017, Forest Hills school district removed its abstinence-only program in favor of the state’s abstinence-based curriculum and additional districts have begun reaching out to the Department of Education for more comprehensive curriculum.
Since Michigan schools are not required to provide sex education to students, school districts are left to decide what type of sex education–if any at all–they provide to youth. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education. Students in Michigan report that sex education curriculum often lacks instruction on consent, information about sexual orientation and gender identity, and utilizes fear tactics to encourage young people to remain abstinent. Further, some parents report that their children have even brought home virginity pledge cards. Advocates from the Michigan Department of Education report that a majority of districts implement some or all of the Michigan Model for Health curriculum. There has been a continuous effort to secure state funding to update this curriculum, as the high school portion was last updated in 2007 and the middle school portion in 2010. As the state curriculum becomes increasingly outdated, districts have begun utilizing more advanced curriculum, including the Rights, Respect, Responsibility curriculum, created by Advocates for Youth.
Advocates note that the biggest barrier to sex education for young people in Michigan is the lack of a state-wide comprehensive sex education requirement. The political makeup of the current legislature also presents a significant challenge in advancing sex education legislation, and advocates note increased support is also needed from the Michigan Department of Education in addition to increased funding for advanced curriculum and teacher training. To address the current gaps in education, organizations such as Planned Parenthood of Michigan and the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health (MOASH) provide sex education programs and resources to young people and advocates across the state. In addition, the Michigan Radical Sex Ed Initiative released a guide on implementing queer and trans-inclusive sex education in 2019 with the support of SIECUS.
Increased support from communities and district boards of education, in addition to an increased number of coalition partners, is needed to advance sex education across the state. Further, advocates report that increased public knowledge and an increased ability to dispel common myths and concerns regarding advanced sex education is needed. Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community receive quality sex education. After contacting their school board of education and sex education advisory board, advocates can raise awareness on important topics missing from local sex education instruction. This can include topics such as medically accurate instruction on contraceptives or curriculum that is culturally responsive to the needs of youth of color and LGBTQ youth. If an advocate’s school district does not require sex education, they can form their own sex education advisory board with the support of community members to directly influence what curriculum recommendations are made to the school board. In addition, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for further inclusive sex education policies and a comprehensive sex education requirement for Michigan schools. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Michigan state law does not require schools to teach sex education. However, HIV/AIDS education is required. As outlined in Michigan Compiled Laws §§ 380.1169–.1170, 380.1506–.1507, and 388.1766–.1766a, schools may also offer sex education instruction, which can include information on family planning, family life education, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention. HIV and sex education must present abstinence as “a responsible method of preventing unwanted or out-of-wedlock pregnancy and [STDs]” and as “a positive lifestyle for unmarried young people.”  If offered, sex education classes must be offered as an elective—not as a graduation requirement.
HIV/AIDS classes may be taught by health care professionals or teachers specifically trained in HIV/AIDS education, and sex education instruction must be provided by teachers qualified to teach health education. All instruction in reproductive health must be taught by qualified instructors and “supervised by a registered physician, a registered nurse, or other person certified by the state board as qualified.” Abortion “shall not be considered a method of family planning, nor shall abortion be taught as a method of reproductive health.” Further, no school official or school board member may dispense any family planning drug or device in school, nor may they make abortion referrals. Districts found in violation of this may face corrective actions, such as being forced to forfeit aid.
School boards must establish an advisory board to review all sex education materials and curricula. This advisory board must include parents, students, educators, clergy, and health professionals. Each school district must also appoint a state-approved sex education program supervisor. All curricula must be approved by the local school board and, if any changes are made, the local school board must hold at least two public hearings on the revisions.
Parents must receive notification of any sex education class and be allowed to review its content, and they may remove their children from any part of the sex education instruction. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.

State Standards
Most Michigan public schools also follow guidelines from the Michigan Model for Health, formerly the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health Education, which promotes nationally recognized and research-based curricula, including curricula on HIV/AIDS prevention. Michigan also provides a set of standards for grades K–8 that guide health education curricula development to ensure that there are a uniform set of content expectations.
In addition, the Michigan Board of Education adopted the Policy to Promote Health and Prevent Disease and Pregnancy, which states that sex education programs must be age-appropriate, developmentally and culturally appropriate, medically accurate, and based on effective programming.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services  prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Michigan’s 2021 session convened on January 13, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Michigan School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health. Below are key instruction highlights for secondary schools in Michigan as reported for the 2017–2018 school year.
