New York’s Sex Education Snapshot
Steady efforts to address barriers in sex education in New York have cumulated in the recent introduction of eight bills to improve sex education curriculum, along with a number of local actions to improve curriculum. Senate Bill 4844, sponsored by Senator Jen Metzger and Senator Velmanette Montgomery, and Assembly Bill 6512, sponsored by Assembly Member Catherine Nolan and Assembly Member Richard Gottfried, took center stage in the 2019 legislative session as part of an effort to pass a statewide comprehensive sex education mandate.
In light of the coronavirus pandemic, legislation concerning sex education was abruptly halted in early 2020 to prioritize pandemic relief efforts. Similarly, advocates pulled public education campaigns to advance sex education due to the increasing pressure of schools to provide effective virtual instruction. Because of the current limitations that come along with virtual learning, advocates are hesitant to advocate for additional sex education requirements. Sex education professionals have also reduced the amount of programming they are able to provide to youth. Due to these limitations, the sex education that young people receive has been significantly reduced.
Statewide, New York schools are only required to provide HIV/AIDS instruction. As a result, school districts are left to decide what type of additional sex education–if any at all–they provide to youth, with curriculum varying by school district. To address discrepancies within New York City (NYC) schools, the Sexuality Ed Alliance of New York City (SEANYC) formed over a decade ago to advocate for improved sex education curriculum in schools. A a result of their work, NYC schools have been required to teach sex education since 2011. While sexual health curriculum, required within the comprehensive health education course, is required to be medically accurate, age appropriate, and skills based, advocates from SEANYC and the Sex Ed Now New York Coalition note that sex education is often only taught for one semester. Therefore, additional requirements are needed to ensure youth receive sex education instruction throughout their K-12 education. In 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio approved measures to establish the Sexual Health Education Task Force. This task force was created to review the sexual health curricula recommended by the New York Department of Education and oversee its implementation. In 2018, the Task Force recommended that the New York City Department of Education prioritize a culture of sexual wellness and inclusivity in all NYC schools, implement additional professional development opportunities for health education instructors, improve the content, substance, and methods of sexual health education, and strengthen accountability and reporting of sexual health education implementation. Students are also taking initiative to improve access to sex education. For example, high school students in the Bronx facilitate a peer-to-peer after school sex education program for 6th grade students through the Women’s Housing and Economic Development Corporation (WHEDco). Because Latino and Black students make up over 50 percent of NYC’s youth population, access to comprehensive, culturally competent sex education curriculum is essential in improving the well-being of marginalized youth across NYC.
Beyond NYC, advocates report that Buffalo Public Schools, Rochester City Schools, one suburban school district, and a minimum of 65 additional schools have policies that require comprehensive sex education. A 2012 report conducted by the New York Civil Liberties Union revealed that inaccurate, incomplete, and stigmatizing curricula continue to be widely utilized across school districts. Organizations such as the Student Support Services Center work to improve access to sex education and have supported 68 school districts in improving their sex education requirements.
Advocates have identified several factors needed to successfully advance sex education statewide. This includes the passage of progressive sex education legislation, increased community support for advanced sex education, stronger sex education coalitions, increased public knowledge of comprehensive sex education, and an increased ability to dispel common myths and concerns associated with advanced sex education.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine what topics are missing from instruction, such as instruction on consent, sexual orientation and gender identity, and contraceptives. They can then vocalize the important need for advancing sex education requirements in their community. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for advancing comprehensive sex education requirements to ensure they are aligned with the National Sexuality Education Standards. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
In New York, Regulations of the Commissioner of Education (§ 135.3) dictate that health education is required for all students in grades K–12. This instruction must provide information about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV/AIDS instruction must be taught by teachers who have been given appropriate training and materials by the board of education or trustees.
All HIV/AIDS education must “provide accurate information to pupils concerning the nature of the disease, methods of transmission, and methods of prevention.” This instruction must be age-appropriate and consistent with community values and “shall stress abstinence as the most appropriate and effective premarital protection against AIDS.” Each local school board must establish an advisory council to make recommendations on HIV/AIDS instruction. Local boards of education may provide for the distribution of condoms in schools. They must ensure that all students who have access to condoms have taken part in an HIV/AIDS education program.
Parents may exempt their children from HIV/AIDS classes as long as the school is given “assurance that the pupil will receive such instruction at home.” This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
New York state does not require or suggest a specific curriculum, but it does provide a curriculum framework, the Learning Standards for Health, Physical Education, and Family and Consumer Sciences at Three Levels. The framework does not specifically mention sex education, though certain topics within sex education are included, such as “understanding of the changes that accompany puberty.” New York state also provides A Guidance Document for Achieving the New York State Standards in Health Education, which is intended only as a guide for developing health curricula. Topic areas mentioned include sexual risk, family life, and sexual health, as well as the prevention of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and pregnancy.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. New York’s 2021 session convened on January 6, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

New York School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.
