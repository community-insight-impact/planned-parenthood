Arkansas’ Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates have worked diligently to advance sex education in Arkansas, most recently cumulating in the introduction of Senate Bill 304 in 2019. Known as the Arkansas Healthy Lifestyle Education Act, the bill sought to require curriculum to include age-appropriate instruction on both abstinence and contraceptives to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as establish an “opt-out” policy for parents to remove their children from sex education instruction. Organizations including Family Council actively worked against Senate Bill 304, and Representative Mark Lowrey attempted to amend the bill to prohibit educators from Planned Parenthood from teaching curriculum in schools. This last measure was later realized in 2021 through the enactment of House Bill 1592, which prohibits public schools or open-enrollment public charter schools from entering into any type of transaction with an individual or entity that provides abortion care. While Senate Bill 304 ultimately failed, sex education advocates were previously successful in passing a 2015 measure that requires schools to provide instruction on dating violence.
In addition to working against efforts to advance sex education, legislators passed a slew of anti-abortion bills in 2019 (House Bill 1439, Senate Bill 2, Senate Bill 149) and in 2021 (House Bill 1646, Senate Bill 6) to restrict access to abortion care and, ultimately, ban it altogether. In the case of Senate Bill 6, The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the ACLU of Arkansas, and Planned Parenthood Federation were granted their Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the restrictive measure on May 26, temporarily blocking the ban from taking effect while the lawsuit continues. 
Affirming abortion as a valid outcome of pregnancy is a critical topic for inclusion within comprehensive sex education programs. Limiting access to abortion further inhibits the ability of young people to make informed decisions about their health and future. Arkansas statute does not require curriculum to include instruction on pregnancy outcomes if sex education is taught in schools.
Regressive legislation can contribute to a culture in which transgender youth are ostracized and prohibited from being their authentic selves. Transgender youth in Arkansas have most recently been targeted by the regressive House Bill 1570, enacted in 2021, which prohibits medical professionals from providing gender-affirming care to minors. A federal judge temporarily blocked the enforcement of this mandate, following the state legislature’s overruling of Governor Hutchinson’s veto of the bill. LGBTQ+ identity has been further stigmatized in Arkansas through the passage of Senate Bill 389, which now mandates parental notification if instruction is provided to young people related to sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Since Arkansas schools are not required to provide sex education to students, school districts are left to decide what type of sex education–if any at all–they provide to youth. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ+ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low-income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education.
Nearly 85 percent of public school districts reported teaching some form of abstinence, and 24 districts reported not teaching sex education at all in 2017. In Phillips County alone, only about half of the county’s educators reported teaching sex education. Students report receiving instruction that is primarily focused on abstinence and includes the use of scare tactics, intended to frighten and shame students into avoiding sexual activity.
GLSEN’s 2017 National School Climate Survey found that almost 90 percent of LGBTQ+ students in Arkansas reported regularly hearing homophobic remarks, and nearly 80 percent of students reported being verbally harassed based on their sexual orientation. 56 percent of students reported being harassed based on their gender expression. These devastating rates demonstrate the critical need for advanced sex education curriculum that includes culturally responsive instruction related to sexual orientation and gender identity, along with bullying and harassment.
To address these barriers, Planned Parenthood Great Plains offers sex education in schools and community organizations and actively works to block restrictive legislation. Unfortunately, House Bill 1592, which now prohibits public schools or open-enrollment public charter schools from entering into any type of transaction with an individual or entity that provides abortion care, threatens these efforts. Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine what topics are missing from sex education instruction, such as instruction on consent, sexual orientation and gender identity, and contraceptives. They can then vocalize the important need for advancing sex education requirements in their community. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for advancing requirements and increasing funding for schools to implement quality sex education. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts.

State Law
Arkansas law does not require schools to teach sex education or HIV or other STIs instruction. If a school offers a sex education or AIDS prevention program, Arkansas Code § 6-18-703 states that abstinence must be stressed, as “it is the policy of the State of Arkansas to discourage … sexual activity by students.” Furthermore, every public school sex education and AIDS prevention education program must “emphasize premarital abstinence as the only sure means of avoiding pregnancy and the sexual contraction of [AIDS] and other [STDs].”
In order to be accredited by the Arkansas Board of Education, education standards require public schools to offer health and safety education, and students are required to complete 0.5 units of health and safety in order to graduate high school. In 2015, Arkansas Code § 6-16-1004 was amended to include dating violence awareness as a mandatory component of health and safety education for students in grades 7-12. Materials must be age-appropriate and based on scientific research.
Local school boards are empowered to establish school-based health clinics, which may provide sex education. Such education must include instruction on abstinence. School-based health clinics may also prescribe and distribute contraceptives with written parental consent. However, no state funds may be used to purchase condoms or contraceptives. Whether or not a school-based health clinic teaches sex education or distributes contraceptives is left to the discretion of the school board. Clinics cannot provide abortion referrals.
Arkansas statutes do not require parental permission for students to participate in sex education or HIV/AIDS instruction, nor do they indicate whether parents or guardians may remove their children from such classes.
State Standards
Arkansas maintains curriculum standards for physical and health education, addressing STIs and HIV beginning in grade five. The curriculum standards stress the importance of abstinence, as well as the possible physical, emotional, and social consequences of sexual activity. Specific course content is left to the discretion of the local school districts.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Arkansas’ 2021 session convened January 11, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Arkansas School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.
Arkansas did not participate in the 2018 School Health Profiles. Below are key instruction highlights for secondary schools in Arkansas as reported for the 2015–2016 school year.
