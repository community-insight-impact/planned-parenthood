Montana’s Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates have focused on working at the local level to advance sex education in Montana over the past decade despite efforts to restrict young people’s access to sex education and reproductive health services. The most recent of these reductive efforts was Senate Bill 99, introduced by Senator Cary Smith (R-27) and enacted on April 30, 2021. The law now requires schools to give written notification to a parent or guardian prior to providing sex education that covers the basic content and the right to remove their children from such instruction. Further, the law prohibits school districts from receiving sex education instruction from any person or entity affiliated with providing abortion care.
In 2010, Helena schools approved a measure to require health curriculum to include, among other topics, instruction on STDs. While an original version of the proposal included instruction on sexual orientation and sexuality, it was removed and amended after receiving significant negative feedback from community members. In 2016, Representatives from EmpowerMT, Planned Parenthood of Montana, Missoula City-County Relationship Violence Services, and Missoula Forum for Children and Youth formed a coalition to provide advanced sex education to Missoula middle school students. These local efforts demonstrate the desire for advanced sex education to compensate for the lack of a statewide mandate.
While Montana schools are required to teach sex education, state statute provides little guidance as to what content or curriculum should be used. As a result, school districts are left to decide what type of instruction they provide to youth. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education.
A 2017 report found that students perceive their instructors to be uncomfortable while providing sex education and even called their sex education experience “useless.” Further, the report found that a majority of educators failed to provide instruction on the differences between biological sex, sexual orientation, sexual behavior, and gender identity.
Youth of color, and Native youth in particular, face unique challenges and systematic barriers in Montana schools. While Native students make up only 11 percent of Montana’s public school student body, they disproportionately represent almost 30 percent of the student dropout rate. This stark contrast demonstrates the critical need for sex education that is culturally responsive to the needs of Native youth to ensure they receive affirming instruction.
To address barriers in education, advocates at Planned Parenthood of Montana have provided comprehensive sex education curriculum in schools for the past 15 years and have established two training programs to address the needs of young people. This includes the one day Sex Education Foundations training for educators and youth-serving individuals and the Rural Sex Ed Curriculum Project, which is specifically targeted to rural schools, including American Indian Reservations, and has a tentative completion date of fall 2021. Unfortunately, under SB 99, the provision of these resources by Planned Parenthood, an entity that provides abortion care, is restricted.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine what topics are missing from instruction, such as instruction on consent, sexual orientation and gender identity, and contraceptives. They can then vocalize the important need for advancing sex education requirements in their community. Advocates can also contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for advancing such requirements. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts.

Administrative Rules §§ 10.53.701-709 codify the health content standards into law.

State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics.  Montana’s legislature does not meet regularly during even years, and is scheduled to meet only periodically throughout 2020. Montana’s 2021 session convened on January 4 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Montana School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.  Below are key instruction highlights for secondary schools in Montana as reported for the 2017–2018 school year.
