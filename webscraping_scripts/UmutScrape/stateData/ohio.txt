Ohio’s Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates have faced a continuously uphill battle toward advancing sex education in Ohio, most recently cumulating in the introduction of several anti-abortion and restrictive sex education bills. House Bill 110, enrolled as the Ohio Operating Appropriation and effective June 30, 2021, allocates $2 million towards abstinence-only programming. This law requires that parental consent is obtained if sex education beyond the mandated topics is provided. Further, House Bill 110 requires an annual audit on each localities sex education instruction and includes mandates that threaten access to reproductive health care services.
In 2019, Representative Niraj Antani introduced House Bill 90 in a regressive attempt to require the State Board of Education to develop an instructional program regarding the “humanity of the unborn child.” While this effort was ultimately unsuccessful, it is part of a larger pattern of legislative attempts to undermine access to abortion care in the state. Another anti-abortion bill, Senate Bill 23, which prohibits abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, successfully passed the legislature. However, U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett issued a preliminary injunction in July of 2019 to temporarily block the measure. It currently awaits further ruling after a series of motions. Additionally, Senate Bill 121 was introduced by Senators Vernon Sykes and Stephanie Kunze in an unsuccessful attempt to allow each school district to develop their own standards and curriculum for “venereal disease education,” that would require curriculum to emphasize abstinence. Further, Senate Bill 121 would also require the State Board of Education to develop health education standards. If implemented correctly, transparent health education standards could advance sex education curriculum statewide.
Sex education is mandated in Ohio and schools are required to provide instruction on abstinence, “venereal disease education,” laws related to sexual activity with minors, healthy relationships, dating violence prevention, and personal safety and assault prevention. However, curriculum is not required to be comprehensive, medically accurate, or include instruction on topics such as consent, sexual orientation or gender identity, or contraceptive options. This leaves local school districts to decide what additional sex education curriculum they provide.
Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low-income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education. While districts like Dublin City Schools provide more comprehensive instruction that includes topics such as sexual harassment, dating safety, and contraception, other schools report not teaching sex education at all despite the state mandate. Some students report that schools in Cuyahoga County provide abstinence-only or “sexual risk avoidance” instruction that is shame-based, misleading, and un-affirming of LGBTQ+ young people.
In an effort to increase access to more comprehensive sex education, organizations such as Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio provide a Peer Education Program and medically accurate, evidence-based sex education programs to schools, parents, youth groups, and community programs.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine what topics are missing from sex education instruction, such as instruction on consent, sexual orientation and gender identity, and contraceptives. Advocates can also focus on ensuring that curriculum is medically accurate or culturally responsive to the needs of young people of color. They can then vocalize the important need for advancing sex education requirements in their community. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for advancing comprehensive sex education requirements statewide. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Ohio Revised Code Sections 3313.60 and 3313.6011 require both sex education and human immunodeficiency (HIV)/sexually transmitted infection (STI) instruction, stating that the board of education of each school district must establish a health education curriculum for “all schools under their control.” The health education curriculum must include “[v]enereal disease education,” which must emphasize that “abstinence from sexual activity is the only protection that is [100 percent] effective against unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease [STD], and the sexual transmission of a virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS].” Additionally, it must:

Stress that students should abstain from sexual activity until after marriage;
Teach the potential physical, psychological, emotional, and social side effects of participating in sexual activity outside of marriage;
Teach that conceiving children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society;
Stress that STDs are serious possible hazards of sexual activity;
Advise students of the laws pertaining to financial responsibility of parents to children born in- and out-of-wedlock; and
Advise students of the circumstances under which it is criminal to have sexual contact with a person under the age of 16, pursuant to section 2907.04 of the Revised Code.
Emphasize adoption as an option for unintended pregnancies.

Upon written request of a parent or guardian, a student may be excused from receiving any or all of this instruction. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
Ohio law does not permit the State Board of Education to adopt the Health Education Standards in Ohio. However, the Ohio Department of Education does provide guidance on the overall health education curriculum requirements, K-6 health education requirements, 7-8 health education requirements, and 9-12 health education requirements. Under these requirements, students receive additional instruction on healthy relationships, dating violence prevention, and personal safety and assault prevention.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Ohio’s 2021 session convened January 4, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Ohio School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.
