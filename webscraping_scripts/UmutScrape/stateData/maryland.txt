Maryland’s Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates have worked diligently over the past four years to further advance sex education in Maryland. In 2018, Delegate Ariana Kelly championed House Bill 251, with the support of her teenage daughter, after repeatedly introducing the bill beginning in 2016. The successful bill requires sex education curriculum to include instruction on the meaning of consent and respect for personal boundaries. In 2019, 25 state delegates and 13 state senators wrote a letter to the Superintendent of Maryland Schools to emphasize the importance of including curriculum that highlights the history of LGBTQ and disability rights movements. In response, the Maryland Department of Education indicated that they have begun the process of implementing such curriculum. While this advancement does not directly impact sex education in Maryland, it demonstrates an important step toward recognizing the value of inclusive curriculum. Previous efforts to advance sex education include the passage of House Bill 72 in 2016. Known as “Erin’s Law,” Maryland schools are now required to provide age-appropriate instruction on sexual abuse and assault prevention.
While legislators have successfully passed legislation to advance sex education, further efforts are underway to undermine access to reproductive health services for minors. House Bill 53, currently in committee, aims to require parental permission for health care providers to insert or implant a contraceptive device into a minor. While parents and guardians play an important role in the decision making process of young people, imposing such requirements may result in some young people choosing not to seek reproductive health care to acquire contraceptive devices.
In addition to these recent statewide efforts, advocates have also worked to advance sex education at the local level. In 2015, the U Choose Campaign, which included Baltimore City Schools, received a multi-million dollar grant to implement a comprehensive sex education program over a five year period, helping reduce the city’s teen pregnancy rate by 61 percent. Prior to the campaign, the Baltimore City Health Department reported that less than 50 percent of Baltimore schools taught reproductive health education or sex education. In 2018, the grant was unexpectedly cut short following federal cuts to teen pregnancy prevention programs. The city of Baltimore sued and won a lawsuit to receive the additional funding.
Maryland schools are required to teach sex education, but curriculum is not required to be comprehensive. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education. Curriculum in Maryland is not required to include instruction on sexual orientation, gender identity, or be culturally responsive to the needs of young people of color.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine if curriculum is required to be comprehensive or identify what topics are missing from instruction, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, contraceptive options, or healthy relationships. They can then vocalize the important need for advancing sex education requirements in their community. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for advancing such requirements statewide. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Maryland Code of Public General Laws §7–401 requires instruction in health education and the joint development of standards and guidelines for school health programs by the Departments of Education and Health and Mental Hygiene. The Administrative Regulation fulfilling this requirement, Md. Code Regs. 13A.04.18.01, mandates that each local school board work with its county health department to establish a broad school health education program, including “Family Life and Human Sexuality” and “Disease Prevention and Control” instruction, both of which encompass sex education topics, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) education. The goals are to enable students to “demonstrate the ability to use human development knowledge, social skills, and health enhancing strategies to promote positive relationships and healthy growth and development throughout the life cycle;” and to “demonstrate the ability to apply prevention and treatment knowledge, skills, and strategies to reduce susceptibility and manage disease.”
The family life and human sexuality component of Maryland’s health education instruction is required to “begin in or prior to the fifth grade,” and “as shortly in advance of puberty as is practical.” Determination of which grade is left to each local school board.
In 2018, Maryland enacted Education Code § 7-445, requiring county boards of education to provide instruction on the meaning of consent, including respecting personal boundaries, in sex education classes.
Schools must provide parents or guardians the opportunity to view all instructional materials prior to their use and parents or guardians may remove their children from any or all “Family Life and Human Sexuality” classes. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
Curriculum development is guided by Maryland’s health education standards, which are based on the National Health Education Standards. Corresponding curriculum framework documents will be available in May 2020. Family life and human sexuality are included in grades K-12. Sexual orientation, gender identity, contraception, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections are all topics of instruction within this recommended framework.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Maryland’s 2021 session convened on January 13, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Maryland School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health. Below are key instruction highlights for secondary schools in Maryland as reported for the 2017-2018 school year.
