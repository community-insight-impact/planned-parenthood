Missouri’s Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates in Missouri have successfully made incremental advancements to Missouri’s sex education requirements and are now considering further efforts to revise the state’s current mandate. In 2015, Representative Genise Montecillo successfully championed House Bill 501, which requires sex education instruction to include information on the dangers of sexual predators and how to remain safe on the internet. In 2018, the legislature passed House Bill 1601, sponsored by Representative Holly Rehder and written collaboratively with University of Missouri students, requiring sex education curriculum to include instruction on consent and sexual violence. Such efforts demonstrate consistent support to make sex education more comprehensive in Missouri and provide a framework that advocates may reference to make further advancements.
In addition to these statewide efforts, grassroots advocacy efforts have also focused on advancing local sex education requirements. Missouri advocates report that there are only a few schools that are providing comprehensive sex education, while the majority of districts provide abstinence-only or abstinence-plus instruction. Parkway School District and Lindbergh School District successfully amended their requirements to ensure students receive more comprehensive and inclusive instruction in 2016 and 2017 respectively, and two additional districts are currently in the process of updating their curriculum. Still, the patchwork nature of Missouri’s sex education curriculum requirements fail to ensure that all students receive the same quality of sex education. Students report that their sex education curriculum continues to lack vital information related to reproductive health, including topics such as endometriosis and other uterine disorders. Further, an abysmal three percent of Missouri students reported receiving LGBTQ-inclusive sex education, according to GLSEN’s 2017 National School Climate Survey.
Since Missouri schools are not required to provide sex education to students, school districts are left to decide what type of sex education–if any at all–they provide to youth. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education.
To bridge the gaps in education, advocates recommend legislation that requires Missouri schools to include instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in their sex education curriculum. To ensure more youth have access to comprehensive instruction, they also recommend that the Missouri legislature amend current provisions that prohibit Planned Parenthood educators from teaching sex education. Further, passing legislation that requires all schools to provide comprehensive sex education would ensure that every student in the state receives quality instruction.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine what topics are missing from sex education instruction, such as instruction on consent, sexual orientation and gender identity, and contraceptives. They can then vocalize the important need for advancing sex education requirements in their community. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for advancing comprehensive sex education requirements. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Missouri schools are required by Missouri Revised Statute § 170.015 to teach health education, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention education, beginning in elementary school. If a school chooses to provide additional sex education, Missouri law mandates that all instruction must be medically and factually accurate and “present abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relation to all sexual activity for unmarried pupils.” In addition, instruction must “advise students that teenage sexual activity places them at a higher risk of dropping out of school because of the consequences of sexually transmitted diseases [STDs] and unplanned pregnancy.”
Among other requirements, the instruction must also:

Stress that [STDs] are serious, possible, health hazards of sexual activity. Pupils shall be provided with the latest medical information regarding exposure to [HIV], [AIDS], human papillomavirus [HPV], hepatitis, and other [STDs];
Present students with the latest medically factual information regarding both the possible side effects and health benefits of all forms of contraception, including the success and failure rates for the prevention of pregnancy and [STDs]; or shall present students with information on contraceptives and pregnancy in a manner consistent with the provisions of the federal abstinence education law, 42 U.S.C. Section 510;
Include a discussion of the possible emotional and psychological consequences of preadolescent and adolescent sexual activity and the consequences of adolescent pregnancy[iv]

The statute was first amended in 2015 to include instruction on “the dangers of sexual predators, including online predators when using electronic communication methods” and “the consequences, both personal and legal, of inappropriate text messaging.” Later, in 2018, the statute was amended again to include instruction on sexual harassment, sexual violence, and consent.
The specific content of human sexuality instruction must be determined by the school board of each school district or charter school. School districts and charter schools are prohibited from providing abortion services and allowing a person and/or entity that provides abortion services to “offer, sponsor, or furnish” course materials related to human sexuality and STDs.
Prior to instruction, school districts and charter schools must make all curriculum materials available for public inspection. Parents have the right to remove their child from any part of the district’s or school’s human sexuality instruction. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
Missouri provides the Health Education Grade-Level Expectations to guide schools in developing a health education curriculum. Teen pregnancy, contraception, and the transmission, treatment, and prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are mentioned, as are “behaviors that could enhance HIV transmission.”
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive healthcare services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Missouri’s 2021 session convened on January 6, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Missouri School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.
