Idaho’s Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates in Idaho have worked to advance sex education at the state and local level in recent years, with their most recent efforts dedicated to defeating House Bill 539, regressive legislation that sought to require parents and guardians to provide their consent for their children to participate in sex education.
In light of the coronavirus pandemic, expansion of sex education programming by state departments has been reportedly limited due to the prioritization of issues by organizations and schools. Further, online learning and limited instructional time with students have resulted in shortened sex education curricula or even self-paced learning of sex education. Advocates report that there is a need for an increased ability to implement online sex education programming to ensure all young people can receive sex education during this unprecedented time.
In addition to limitations in providing sex education amid the pandemic, recent legislation has also increased barriers to young people receiving reproductive health services. House Bill 366, enrolled as Ch. 289 on April 29, prohibits abortion after a fetal heartbeat has been detected unless in the case of a medical emergency.
In 2019, advocates worked to ensure a restrictive parental “opt-in” bill, House Bill 120, did not pass the state legislature. In the year prior, Representative Julie VanOrden introduced House Bill 414 which sought to require sex education curriculum to be medically accurate and include instruction on healthy relationships. Representative VanOrden later introduced House Bill 579 which removed the previous bill’s inclusion of healthy relationships and included recognition of the importance of families in their children’s education. Although both bills maintained an emphasis on local control of sex education curriculum, including families and community groups in the planning process, and allowed students to be excused from sex education instruction, the bills sparked public debate. Opponents such as the Family Policy Alliance of Idaho believed House Bill 579 to be a direct attack on the rights of parents to direct their children’s education. While both bills sought to advance sex education in 2018, further regressive efforts in 2019 demonstrated a range of public opinions among Idaho residents. In 2019, Representative Barbara Ehardt introduced House Bill 120 in an effort to require parents to provide their consent before their children could participate in a sex education course. This is referred to as an “opt-in” policy and presents an unnecessary barrier to receiving sex education, given that parents are already able to remove their children from instruction under Idaho’s “opt-out” policy. Advocates strongly opposed the bill and successfully prevented its passage.
Since Idaho schools are not required to provide sex education to students, school districts are left to decide what type of sex education–if any at all–they provide. While Idaho’s standards require curriculum to encourage abstinence, include instruction on pregnancy and disease prevention and the consequences of sexual activity, healthy relationships, puberty, and STDs, local school districts determine if they want to provide additional instruction. As a consequence, advocates report that the quality of sex education being taught varies greatly by district. Some districts provide comprehensive sex education, while many provide abstinence-only instruction and the remaining choose not to teach sex education at all. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and  LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low-income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education.
Idaho schools have previously demonstrated their disinterest in recognizing the needs of LGBTQ youth after a majority of public schools failed to adopt protective policies on gender identity and gender expression proposed by the Idaho School Board Association in 2015. Research has recently found that increased support for LGBTQ students drastically improves mental health outcomes for these young people. Increased action is necessary to ensure LGBTQ youth receive the support they need in order to succeed.
Advocates report that the embroiled political climate in Idaho paired with the minimal health education requirements and a lack of resources to advance sex education create significant barriers to implementing comprehensive sex education across the state. There’s an identified need for increased community support for advanced sex education, and an increased number of statewide coalition partners.
In an effort to provide young people with access to comprehensive sex education, Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho have begun facilitating a Youth Empowerment Program. Within this program, young people are trained as peer educators to empower young people in their communities to prioritize their sexual and reproductive health.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After identifying what topics are missing from local sex education requirements, advocates can vocalize the importance of implementing specific elements of comprehensive sex education with a focus on ensuring that local LGBTQ youth receive the support they need through the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity in sex education instruction. Current advocates report that increased community education is essential to fight against future efforts to implement a parental opt-in policy and successfully implement advanced sex education curriculum. Those seeking to become involved in advancing sex education can start by addressing misconceptions concerning comprehensive sex education and the benefits of implementing more comprehensive curriculum.
Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for updated health education requirements, increased funding and staff to support districts with the implementation of advanced curriculum, and the importance of amending the current statute to require inclusive sex education statewide. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Sex education is not mandated in Idaho. Idaho Statute §33-1608 states that the “primary responsibility of family life and sex education” rests with a student’s home and church and that “the schools can only complement and supplement those standards which are established in the family.” Local school boards may decide to offer sex education. If a school board institutes sex education, the program must place “major emphasis” on the home (including “appreciation of the important place the family home holds in the social system of our culture”), family, and church as areas of importance for learning such knowledge. School boards must include parents and community groups in all aspects of instituting and evaluating sex education programs.
In addition, the statute states that programs should give young people “the scientific, physiological information for understanding sex and its relation to the miracle of life.” They must also include “knowledge of the power of the sex drive and the necessity of controlling that drive by self-discipline.”
Parents or guardians who wish to excuse their children from sex education must file a written request to the school board. The school board will then supply the parent with the necessary forms to remove the child from the class. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
For schools offering sex education, the Idaho Department of Education’s Idaho Content Standards for Health Education requires content related to the “consequences of sexual activity” beginning in grades 6-8. By grade 12, this content should include “encouragement of abstinence from sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (e.g., transmission and prevention), and pregnancy prevention.” All information should be “factual, medically accurate, and objective.”
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Idaho’s 2021 session convened on January 11, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Idaho School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.
