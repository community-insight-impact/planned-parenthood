Illinois’ Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates have taken significant action over the past seven years to advance sex education in Illinois, most recently cumulating in the passage of three proactive bills. Senate Bill 818, enrolled as Public Act 102-0522, was introduced by Senator Ram Villivalam (D-08) and enacted on August 20th, 2021. This law requires educators to teach comprehensive sex education that is age, culturally, and developmentally appropriate, medically accurate, complete, inclusive, trauma-informed, and replicates evidence-based or evidence-informed programs. In 2019,  House Bill 3299, introduced by Representative William Davis, was enacted, which requires developmental disability facilities to provide developmentally appropriate sex education and related resources to anyone admitted. Additionally, House Bill 3550, introduced by Representative Ann Williams,  was enacted and now requires sex education curriculum to include instruction on consent. Further, House Bill 246, sponsored by Representative Anna Moeller, was enacted and now requires public schools to include the contributions of LGBT people in history courses, further demonstrating legislators’ increasing recognition of the importance of inclusive curriculum. 
In 2013, legislators advanced sex education requirements through the passage of House Bill 2675, which requires sex education curriculum to include instruction on both abstinence as a responsible and positive decision and contraception. The amendment also requires curriculum to be medically accurate and developmentally/age-appropriate.
While these legislative actions all mark significant advancements for sex education in Illinois, opponents, including the Illinois Family Institute, have routinely advocated limiting sex education. Such opposition enables the current patchwork landscape. Since Illinois schools are only required to provide limited instruction on abstinence and HIV/AIDS prevention, school districts are left to decide whether they provide sex education to youth.  If a school chooses to teach sex education, curriculum is required to be comprehensive, including curriculum that is age and developmentally appropriate, medically accurate, complete, culturally appropriate, inclusive, trauma-informed, and replicates evidence-based or evidence-informed programs. Curriculum must also include instruction on both abstinence and contraception, consent, sexual abuse, assault awareness, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention, and teach “honor and respect” for heterosexual marriage. Further, family life education courses are required to teach the alternatives to abortion. However, sex education curriculum must cover all potential pregnancy outcomes and include stigma-free information about abortion.
Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low-income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education.
Even among districts that mandate sex education, curriculum continues to vary. Although the Chicago Public Schools system mandates sex education, a recent report found that only 28 percent of Chicago schools taught all required sex education topics in all grade levels. Community members are currently working to further understand which schools fail to meet the city’s requirements.
To address the current gaps in education, organizations, such as the Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health, offer youth workshops that meet the National Sexuality Education Standards. These workshops are facilitated by youth educators, adult educators, and theater artists. Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine what topics are missing from sex education, such as instruction that is culturally responsive to the needs of young people of color or instruction on topics including sexual orientation and gender identity. They can then vocalize the important need for advancing sex education requirements in their community. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for advancing comprehensive sex education requirements statewide, such as by mandating instruction. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
The Illinois Critical Health Problems and Comprehensive Health Education Act states that the following topics must be addressed in all elementary and secondary schools:
[H]uman ecology and health, human growth and development; the emotional, psychological, physiological, hygienic, and social responsibilities of family life, including sexual abstinence until marriage; [and the] prevention and control of disease, including instruction in grades 6 through 12 on the prevention, transmission, and spread of [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] AIDS.
As of 2013, schools that teach sex education are no longer required to emphasize that “abstinence is the expected norm” and are instead expected to teach both abstinence and contraception. All courses that discuss sexual intercourse are to address “the hazards of sexual intercourse . . . [and] the latest medical information citing the failure and success rates of condoms,” and include explanations of when it is “unlawful for males to have sexual relations with females under the age of 18.” Course material must also include information regarding responsible parenting.
In 2014, the Illinois State Board of Education published Public Act 98-0441 to provide further details on state sex education requirements.
In 2018, Illinois enrolled Public Act 100-0684, requiring sex education instruction to include discussion on consent, sexual harassment, and sexual assault; and Public Act 100-1043, requiring the State Board of Education to implement a pilot program including instruction on parenting education for grades 9-12, which may be included in sex education classes.
Illinois law also provides guidelines for family life education courses. These courses are “designed to promote wholesome and comprehensive understanding of the emotional, psychological, physiological, hygienic, and social responsibility aspects of family life,” and therefore must “include the teaching of the alternatives to abortion, appropriate to the various grade levels.”
The Illinois Superintendent of Education must prepare the course of instruction for family life education, make it available to school districts, and “develop a procedure for evaluating and measuring the effectiveness of the family life courses of instruction in each local school district, including the setting of reasonable goals for reduced sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and premarital pregnancy.”
Parents or guardians may remove their children from any or all sex education, family life programs, and/or STD/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention programs. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
The Illinois Learning Standards for Physical Development and Health was updated in 2014 but does not provide curriculum guidance for sex education and only briefly mentions that students should be able to “explain the basic functions of the reproductive system” by grade eight and “demonstrate basic knowledge of HIV and AIDS.” The Standards also address effective communication and decision-making skills.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services.  Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. The Illinois General Assembly is organized in a two-year cycle called a biennium. The 2021-2022 session convened January 13, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Illinois School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health. Below are key instruction highlights for secondary schools in Illinois as reported for the 2017–2018 school year.
Reported teaching all 20 critical sexual health education topics

17% of Illinois secondary schools taught students all 20 critical sexual health education topics in a required course in any of grades 6, 7, or 8.
44.8% of Illinois secondary schools taught students all 20 critical sexual health education topics in a required course in any of grades 9, 10, 11, or 12.

Reported teaching about the benefits of being sexually abstinent
