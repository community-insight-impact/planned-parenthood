Alabama’s Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates across the state have worked tirelessly to advance Alabama’s sex education requirements over the past several years. Although legislation mandating comprehensive sex education has yet to be successful, the efforts of dedicated advocates across the state have most recently culminated in the passage House Bill 385, marking progress in Alabama’s sex education curriculum requirements. House Bill 385 was introduced by Representative Laura Hall (D-19) and enacted on April 20 2021, requiring sex education instruction to be medically accurate, removing the requirement for materials to highlight stigmatizing and false information about LGBTQ+ identities, and shifting instruction from an emphasis on self-control and ethical behavior to an emphasis on the importance of delaying sexual activity and discouraging risky sexual behavior. However, the coronavirus pandemic has continued to pose numerous barriers to ensuring all young people receive sex education across the state. Advocates report that the pandemic has significantly restricted their ability to provide sex education programming in schools and community organizations, but they are working to adapt curricula to fit a virtual format. They’ve also identified additional means of advocacy, including creating a sex education advocacy video with statewide partners to send to legislators and adapting educator trainings to an online platform. 
Sex education is not currently mandated in Alabama, and schools that do teach sex education must emphasize abstinence. Because Alabama schools are not required to provide sex education to students, school districts are left to decide what type of sex education–if any at all–they provide to youth. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Despite the passage of House Bill 385, such discretion still allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low-income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education. Black youth in particular face racist, systemic barriers to health care and comprehensive education. This has resulted in disproportionate representation among a variety of adverse health outcomes. For example, in 2013, nearly 80 percent of new HIV diagnoses among people ages 15-29 living in Alabama were reported among Black young youth. Additionally, over 70 percent of new HIV diagnoses among men living in Alabama were reported by men who have had sex with men.
Advocates across the state report that evidence-based and culturally responsive information are among the biggest factors missing from Alabama’s sex education curriculum. In efforts to alleviate these barriers, the George Washington Carver High School in Birmingham has worked closely with health care providers to ensure they provide comprehensive sex education to students. Planned Parenthood South East also facilitates the Teen Advocates for Sexual Health Program (TASH), a peer education group that serves five schools from the Birmingham and Hoover School District. State advocates such as the Alabama Campaign for Adolescent Sexual Health have worked to ensure students receive evidence-based and evidence-informed curriculum through providing curricula training to educators, creating sexual health resources, and advocating for improved sexual health policies. In 2020, Human Rights Watch released  “‘It Wasn’t Really Safety, It Was Shame’: Young People, Sexual Health Education, and HPV in Alabama,” which highlights the stark gaps in access to comprehensive sex education and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for Alabama youth.
State advocates in Alabama have reported that educators often lack information concerning the state’s sex education policy and are afraid of implementing the wrong curriculum. As a result, many opt to not provide any sex education at all. To advance sex education, advocates report a need for increased support from the Alabama Department of Education and increased collaboration between current state partners. There is also a need for increased public knowledge regarding the need to advance sex education in addition to a heightened ability to address common myths and concerns associated with comprehensive sex education. Increased funding for advanced sex education in addition to teacher training has also been identified as a significant barrier in advancing sex education.
Right now, advocates can take action in their communities to address misinformation about Alabama’s sex education requirements. They can contact their local board of education and determine what topics are missing from existing sex education curricula. Advocates can then vocalize the importance of implementing specific elements of comprehensive sex education, such as trauma-informed, culturally responsive curriculum that addresses the needs of youth of color and LGBTQ youth, or medically accurate instruction on contraceptives, healthy relationships, and consent. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for a statewide comprehensive sex education mandate. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Alabama state law does not require the teaching of sex education. However, a resolution adopted by the Alabama State Board of Education in 1987 does require that students in grades 5–12 receive instruction about HIV/AIDS through a health education program. Should schools choose to offer additional sex education, Alabama State Code Section 16-40A-2 sets minimum requirements for what must be taught, but specific content is developed locally. Among other things, the code requires “sex education or the human reproductive process” programs or curricula to include and emphasize that:

abstinence from sexual intercourse is the only completely effective protection against unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and AIDS when transmitted sexually.
abstinence from sexual intercourse outside of lawful marriage is the expected social standard for unmarried school-age persons.

The code also states that:

B. course materials and instruction that relate to sexual education or STDs should be age-appropriate;
C. course materials and instruction that relate to sexual education or STDs should include:

2. An emphasis on the importance of self-control and ethical conduct pertaining to sexual behavior.
3. Statistics based on the latest medical information that indicates the degree of reliability and unreliability of various forms of contraception, while also emphasizing the increase in protection against pregnancy and protection against STDs, including HIV and AIDS, afforded by the use of various contraceptive measures …

Parents or guardians may remove their children from instruction pertaining to “disease, its symptoms, development, and treatment” if the content is in conflict with their religious beliefs. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
In addition to this code, Alabama Course of Study: Health Education provides the foundation for the minimum content requirements for topics such as HIV, STIs, and pregnancy prevention. The sexuality topics covered include: “societal expectations of remaining abstinent until married,” the “physical, social, and emotional effects,” of STIs, disease transmission, responsible decision-making, and refusal skills, among others.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. 2021 Session: Convened February 2, 2021

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Alabama School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.
