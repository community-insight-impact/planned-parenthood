Tennessee’s Sex Education Snapshot
In 2012 the Tennessee legislature passed Senate Bill 3310, a restrictive measure known as the “Gateway Law.” Under this legislation, family life education programs and sex education courses are prohibited from including instruction on “gateway sexual activity” that encourages youth to engage in “non-abstinent behavior.” Educators who fail to comply could face punitive measures, including a $500 fine. Sex education advocates have routinely pushed back against this restrictive legislation and have attempted to, instead, pass requirements for comprehensive sex education. In 2017, Senator Becky Duncan Massey passed Senate Bill 1510, legislation that requires sexual abuse education in schools. Despite this success, similar efforts have been largely unsuccessful. 
Tennessee passed more restrictive measures on sex education and health care for minors in 2021 with House Bill/Senate Bill 1229 and House Bill 1027. House Bill/Senate Bill 1229, introduced by Representative Debra Moody, requires schools to provide parental notification at least 30 days prior to commencing instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in any subject and permits parents to opt their children out of such instruction. House Bill 1027, introduced by Representative Sabi Kumar and enacted on May 21, prohibits medical professionals from providing gender-affirming care to minors prior to puberty.
Recently enacted laws (Senate Bill 1360 and House Bill 577/Senate Bill 1392) have a mixed impact on sex education. Senate Bill 1360 advances education by requiring each local education agency to provide family life education. House Bill 577/Senate Bill 1392 amends requirements regarding instruction on contraception to ensure it is medically accurate, age-appropriate, in compliance with state statute, aligned to state academic standards, and available for parental review.
Collaborative efforts are underway to ensure a comprehensive sex education bill is introduced in the future, although increased grassroots action is critical to its passage. Advocates note that incremental efforts to build a strong base of support are essential to ensure future success. Organizations such as Girls, Inc. of Chattanooga are working to identify political allies and local champions to advance a comprehensive sex education platform.
In light of the coronavirus pandemic beginning in 2020, the shortened legislative session significantly limited the ability to conduct successful advocacy with lawmakers to advance sex education legislation. Advocates suspect that sex education was likely one of the first educational programs to be eliminated in the shift towards virtual learning. While advocates have begun the process of developing an awareness campaign to advance sex education requirements, the implementation has been halted as the impact of the virus has continued into 2021.
In addition to coordinated efforts to pass advanced sex education requirements statewide, advocates note that much needs to be done at the local level as well. While all local education agencies are required to teach family life education, curriculum must stress abstinence. Due to the state’s restrictive mandate, schools in Tennessee can only provide abstinence-centered curriculum, which is often called “sexual risk avoidance” programming.  There is also a prominent fear of discussing restricted topics that remains prevalent among educators in the state. Students report that educators often use shame-based, stigmatizing educational tools that target young women and LGBTQ students. These approaches create unsafe and hostile environments for young people. Curriculum has also been reported to lack critical topics such as contraceptive methods, STI prevention, and consent. While all young people in Tennessee are adversely impacted by restrictive sex education curriculum, Black youth in particular are put at a significant disadvantage. SisterReach, a reproductive justice organization based in Memphis, released a report in 2015 detailing the unique barriers that Black young people face in accessing comprehensive sex education and found that 90 percent of youth surveyed reported that they received inadequate information and felt unable to make informed decisions about their own bodies and sexual choices.
Advocates in Knoxville have been increasing efforts to ensure effective educators are delivering sex education by removing harmful educators that provide restrictive instruction. They believe this is a necessary first step before advancing new sex education requirements. In response to the discriminatory sex education they received, students in Knox County have formed Just Educate, a sex education resource, to uplift the testimony of students and demand that the Knox County Board of Education take action to ensure young people receive affirming sex education instruction. 
In an effort to address these gaps in access, Youth and Family Development Centers and youth-serving organizations across the state have implemented after-school sex education programs. Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi has provided similar programming in Knoxville, Memphis, Nashville, and the surrounding areas. Despite these efforts, advocates from the Women’s Fund of Chattanooga report that it is critical that those who support advancing sex education continue to strategize effective ways to provide comprehensive sex education to youth.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. Advocates can also identify what sex education requirements are currently in place in their district and advocate for the inclusion of specific elements of comprehensive sex education, such as requiring curriculum to be culturally responsive to youth of color and LGBTQ youth. Chattanooga community members report a recent, steady increase in local support for improving sex education. Individuals across the state may find that parents and community members are willing to collaborate and advocate for inclusive sex education curriculum. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Tennessee law (§ 49-6-1302, 49-6-1304, and 49-6-1305) requires local education agencies to develop and implement a family life education program. These programs must promote “sexual risk avoidance” as their primary goal, and instruction that promotes “gateway sexual activity” is prohibited. Statute § 49-6-1304 was recently amended to include “provid[ing] instruction on the detection, intervention, prevention, and treatment of child sexual abuse, including such abuse that may occur in the home” as a required topic in family life curricula.
If such family life education programs are provided, they must:

Emphatically promote sexual risk avoidance through abstinence, regardless of a student’s current or prior sexual experience;
Encourage sexual health by helping students understand how sexual activity affects the whole person, including the physical, social, emotional, psychological, economic, and educational consequences of non-marital sexual activity;
Teach the positive results of avoiding sexual activity, the skills needed to make healthy decisions, the advantages of and skills for student success in pursuing educational and life goals, the components of healthy relationships, and the social science research supporting the benefits of reserving the expression of human sexual activity for marriage;
Provide factually and medically accurate information;
Teach students how to form pro-social habits that enable students to develop healthy relationships, create strong marriages, and form safe and stable future families;
Encourage students to communicate with a parent, guardian, or other trusted adult about sex or other risk behaviors;
Assist students in learning and practicing refusal skills that will help them resist sexual activity;
Address the benefits of raising children within the context of a marital relationship and the unique challenges that single teen parents encounter in relation to educational, psychological, physical, social, legal, and financial factors;
Discuss the interrelationship between teen sexual activity and exposure to other risk behaviors such as smoking, underage drinking, drug use, criminal activity, dating violence, and sexual aggression;
Educate students on the age of consent, puberty, pregnancy, childbirth, sexually transmitted diseases [STDs], including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], and the financial and emotional responsibility of raising a child;
Teach students how to identify and form healthy relationships, and how to identify and avoid unhealthy relationships;
Inform students, in all [schools], concerning the process of adoption and its benefits; and
Provide instruction on the detection, intervention, prevention, and treatment of child sexual abuse, including such abuse that may occur in the home.

Tennessee Code allows students to be removed from sex education classes upon written request from their parent or guardian. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
The Tennessee Health Education Standards include instruction on sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, beginning in grade 3. Beginning in grade 6, the standards include the expectation that students will learn to “identify abstinence from sexual activity as the responsible and preferred choice for adolescents.” The Tennessee Lifetime Wellness Curriculum Standards , which students must complete in order to graduate high school, mandate a section on sexuality and relationships. The standards describe abstinence as a “positive choice” but also include instruction on contraception.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Tennessee’s 2021 session convened on January 12, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being. To learn more about Tennessee’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) results, click here.
Tennessee School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices.
