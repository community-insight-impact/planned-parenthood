Massachusetts’ Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates in Massachusetts have worked tirelessly to advance the Healthy Youth Act. First introduced in 2011, the Healthy Youth Act would ensure youth receive research-based, medically accurate, and culturally competent sex education in districts that require sex education. Broad public support for the bill is often met with opposition from the Massachusetts Family Institute. While the Healthy Youth Act has successfully passed the Senate in the past two legislative sessions, it has routinely been blocked from being introduced in the House. In 2019, Representative Paul Brodeur and Representative James J. O’Day introduced House Bill 410 in another unsuccessful attempt to pass the Healthy Youth Act. In 2021, Senator Dan Sena led the introduction of the latest iteration of the Healthy Youth Act, Senate Bill 2541, which passed the Senate on September 23.  Additional sustained efforts to advance sex education have been implemented in varying manners. Funding through the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) and the Department of Public Health assist districts in selecting and accessing training on high quality sex education in partnership with organizations such as ANSWER, ETR, Planned Parenthood League of MA, and Advocates for Youth.
Since Massachusetts schools are not required to provide sex education to students, school districts are left to decide what type of sex education–if any at all–they provide to youth. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Many districts, including Boston Public Schools, use the Rights, Respect, Responsibility (3R’s) curriculum, but over 70 percent of districts use “abstinence-plus” instructional materials. Advocates are working to provide sex education curriculum that is not delivered in a gender-segregated manner, which is often alienating to transgender, nonbinary, and/or gender nonconforming young people. Additional efforts by the DESE are being made to update the Health Curriculum Framework to ensure that discussion of consent is gender inclusive and trauma informed. Addressing these barriers in sex education curriculum will ensure that all youth receive affirming instruction.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local school board, advocates can determine what topics are missing from sex education instruction, such as instruction on consent, sexual orientation and gender identity, and contraceptives. Local initiatives to address sex education are present across the state, and advocates can use initiatives such as the Holyoke Adolescent Sexual Health and Pregnancy Prevention Task Force Accountability Committee to guide efforts to improve their community’s sex education. In addition to local efforts to improve sex education curriculum, advocates must continue to contact their representatives and urge them to support the Healthy Youth Act during the 2020 legislative session and take part in local action to raise awareness concerning this critical opportunity to advance sex education in Massachusetts. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Massachusetts does not require sex education but instead allows local school boards to make such decisions. If a community decides to implement sex education, General Law of Massachusetts, Chapter 71 §§38O requires that standards be developed with the guidance of community stakeholders, including parents and at least one physician. In 1990, the Massachusetts Board of Education approved a policy that:
[U]rges local school districts to create programs which make instruction about [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] (AIDS)/[human immunodeficiency virus] (HIV) available to every Massachusetts student at every grade level. These programs should be developed in a manner which respects local control over education and involves parents and representatives of the community. The Board believes that AIDS/HIV prevention education is most effective when integrated into a comprehensive health education and human services program.
Every district implementing or maintaining curriculum which primarily involves human sexual education or human sexuality issues is required to adopt a policy ensuring parental/guardian notification.  This policy must afford parents or guardians the flexibility to exempt their children from any portion of said curriculum through written notification to the school principal.
State Standards
The Massachusetts Comprehensive Health Framework, currently set to be updated in early 2020, suggests that curricula include information about “abstaining from and postponing sexual intercourse,” and approaches reproduction and sexuality “in an appropriate and factual fashion”.  In addition, it states that human sexuality instruction should discuss HIV/AIDS, teen pregnancy, family violence, sound health practices, and “define sexual orientation using the correct terminology (such as heterosexual and gay and lesbian).”
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services  prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Massachusetts’ 2021-2022 session convened on January 6, 2021

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being. To learn more about Massachusetts’ Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) results, click here.
Massachusetts School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health. Below are key instruction highlights for secondary schools in Massachusetts as reported for the 2017–2018 school year.
