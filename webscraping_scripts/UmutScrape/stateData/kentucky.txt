Kentucky’s Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates have worked diligently to advance sex education in Kentucky over the past few years, most recently cumulating in the introduction of House Bill 296, known as the Education for Healthy Youth Act. This bill, introduced by Representative Lisa Willner, sought to require comprehensive sex education in all Kentucky schools for students in grades K-12. While ultimately unsuccessful, the bill marks an important effort to continue to advance curriculum. The bill follows the re-introduction of House Bill 185  during the 2019 legislative session. Introduced by Representative Tom Burch, the bill sought to establish curriculum standards for sex education in grades 4-12, but was ultimately unsuccessful. While these recent efforts aimed to advance sex education, past legislative actions have attempted to restrict curriculum. In 2018, Senate Bill 71 was signed into law and requires sex education curriculum to include instruction on abstinence as the desirable goal for young people and the only certain way to avoid unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and other associated health problems. It also requires teaching that establishing a permanent, mutually faithful, monogamous relationship is the best way to avoid STDs.
While Kentucky schools are required to provide instruction on responsible sexual behavior, including abstinence and preventing pregnancy, preventing STDs, and the basic reproductive system and functions, local school boards are responsible for identifying any additional curriculum schools provide. Curriculum is not required to be medically accurate, culturally responsive to the needs of young people of color, or include instruction on topics such as sexual orientation, gender identity, consent, healthy relationships, or contraceptive options. Young people’s access to health services and accurate information is further limited by restrictions on reproductive health care and abortion rights, such as those imposed by House Bill 91, enacted on March 30, 2021 and introduced by Representative Joe Fischer. This bill, enrolled as Ch. 174, amends the Constitution of Kentucky to state that nothing in the Constitution secures or protects the right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion care.
While some counties, such as Lee County Schools, offer comprehensive sex education, others continue to fail to meet the needs of young people. Students report that curriculum continues to fall short and express a need for instruction on sexual abuse, consent, contraception and healthy relationships within sex education instruction. One student, a survivor of sexual assault, reported that her abstinence-only instructor made her feel like “damaged goods” after comparing women who have premarital sex to used pieces of tape. Advocates report that the current state standards are so vague that educators are often unsure of what they are permitted to teach, and opt to not teach sex education at all.
Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education.
In efforts to further advance sex education in Kentucky, coalitions such as Louisville Sex Education Now and Lex Ed are working to advance comprehensive sex education in Jefferson County Public Schools and Fayette County Public Schools. Sexy Sex Ed, an Appalachian-based organization, also provides after-school programming for young people and facilitates trainings to teach community members how to facilitate a sex education workshop.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. In 2017, a report found that a majority of parents whose children attended middle school in a rural Appalachian town believe that sex education should begin in middle school and that abstinence-plus curriculum should be taught. These results demonstrate a unique opportunity for advocates to increase support for quality sex education. After identifying what topics are missing from local sex education requirements, advocates can vocalize the importance of implementing specific elements of comprehensive sex education, such as trauma informed, culturally responsive curriculum that addresses the needs of youth of color and LGBTQ youth and includes instruction on consent, healthy relationships, and contraceptives. Advocates can also emphasize the importance of requiring curriculum to be evidence-based and medically accurate. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for advancing sex education requirements and increasing funding to support the implementation of comprehensive sex education in districts that lack the capacity to do so. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Kentucky Revised Statute 156:160 requires that the Kentucky Board of Education “promulgate administrative regulations establishing standards [that public] school districts shall meet.” With that authority, 704 KAR 3:305 was promulgated, requiring students to take 0.5 credits of health education in order to graduate. It also requires the health education course to include the content standards delineated in the Kentucky Core Academic Standards. Furthermore, 704 KAR 3:303 adopted the Kentucky Academic Standards into law.
In 2018, Kentucky enacted Chapter 156, stating that any human sexuality or STD curricula must include instruction on abstinence, state that “abstinence from sexual activity is the desirable goal for all school-age children,” and advocate for “permanent mutually faithful monogamous relationship[s].”
Kentucky statute does not require parental permission for students to participate in sexuality or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related instruction.
State Standards
Sex education is mentioned within the “Practical Living (Health and Physical Education)” section of the Kentucky Academic Standards, which schools are required to follow. Students learn “how decision-making relates to responsible sexual behavior (e.g., abstinence, preventing pregnancy, preventing HIV/[sexually transmitted diseases] (STDs), and impacts the physical, mental, and social well-being of an individual.” Students also learn about the basic reproductive system and functions. No specific curriculum is required.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Kentucky’s 2021 session convened on January 5, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Kentucky School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health. Below are key instruction highlights for secondary schools in Kentucky as reported for the 2017–2018 school year.
