Hawaii’s Sex Education Snapshot
Advocates have successfully worked to advance sex education in Hawaii over the past five years, most recently cumulating in the introduction of a series of bills (House Bill 385 and House Bill 386) that sought to advance requirements and include instruction on sexual abuse. Unfortunately, both bills failed to pass.
In light of the coronavirus pandemic, the move to virtual learning has reduced the likelihood that young people will receive sex education. In addition, the state Legislature’s move to a digital platform has also reduced the ability for advocates to provide their input on legislation concerning sex education and reproductive health care services. Advocates report that sex education is not currently a priority for virtual instruction, and educators are not prepared to teach it in a virtual manner. To advance sex education, its critical that the pandemic is resolved so that in-person instruction may resume.
After years of dedicated campaigning from advocates, the State Board of Education voted to remove Hawaii’s “opt-in” policy and update Hawaii’s sex education requirements in 2015. The policy requires schools to provide sex education that is medically accurate, age appropriate, and culturally responsive. Despite this success, advocates report that the policy is not yet fully implemented in Hawaii schools and that the Department of Education has not taken steps to secure necessary resources, including funds for curricula or additional training for educators. As a result, advocates are working hard to get the Department of Education to report its progress in implementing the 2015 sex education policy to the legislature.
In 2019, Hawaii joined eight states in refusing funding from the Title X Family Planning Program after the Trump administration began enforcing a domestic gag rule. As a result, many advocates have shifted attention away from sex education to focus efforts on ensuring Hawaii’s family planning clinics are able to continue providing the comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care that Hawaiians need. However, as part of their efforts to maintain these necessary services, Hawaiians should remain vigilant in advancing sex education as well. When young people receive comprehensive sex education, they are able to develop an understanding, early on, of how and why access to this type of care is essential for any community.
Hawaii schools are now required to teach sex education that is age appropriate, medically accurate and includes instruction on abstinence, contraception, and methods to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, curriculum is not required to be comprehensive or to include instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity. Mandating local control over sex education presents unique challenges that have resulted in a glaring disparity regarding the quality of sex education that students receive. Such discretion allows for the implementation of policies and curriculum that stigmatize marginalized youth, such as students of color and LGBTQ youth, and presents further challenges in ensuring that low income districts have access to the resources needed to implement comprehensive sex education. Advocates believe that the Department of Education is not prioritizing sex education, which has resulted in delayed implementation of the newly mandated sex education requirements.
Right now, advocates can take action to ensure young people in their community have access to quality sex education. After contacting their local schools, advocates can determine what topics are currently missing from the sex education curriculum, such as legally mandated medically accurate and culturally responsive curriculum in addition to instruction on topics such as healthy relationships and consent. Further, advocates can contact their representatives to discuss the critical need for the Department of Education to support schools in implementing the current sex education requirements and passing legislation that further advances sex education in Hawaii. Advocates are encouraged to use the SIECUS Community Action Toolkit to guide local efforts to advance sex education.

State Law
Sexual health education is mandated in Hawaii as of 2015. The Hawaii State Board of Education was established by the Hawaii State Constitution, which grants the board power to formulate and establish statewide educational policy. On June 16, 2015, Hawaii’s Board of Education policy was updated to read, “the Department of Education shall provide sexual health education to include age appropriate, medically accurate health education that includes education on abstinence, contraception, and methods of infection prevention to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).” It further encourages students to communicate with their parents and/or guardians about sexuality and stresses that abstinence “from sexual intercourse is the surest way to prevent unintended pregnancies, [STIs] such as HIV/[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] (AIDS), and consequent emotional distress.” Hawaii’s education policy 103-8 further states that birth control devices may be discussed during human reproduction studies. However, “the distribution of condoms and other prophylactic devices to students shall be prohibited in the classroom, on the school campus, or at any school-related activities.”
Hawaii does not require parental permission for students to participate in sexuality or HIV/AIDS education, but they may remove their children from the course. This is referred to as an “opt-out” policy.
State Standards
Hawaii’s Content and Performance Standards for health courses state that sexual health should be addressed, and the standards inform schools about which content areas must be covered. However, the standards do not give curricula guidelines or go into detail regarding what topics should be discussed. Examples provided in the standards include that the student should be able to identify “when and how to access health services (e.g., teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, and mental health services).” Seven approved curricula are listed online.
State Legislative Activity 
State legislative activity related to sex education does not take place in isolation from the broader embroiled political and policy climate. Attacks on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals, and efforts to limit access to abortion care and other reproductive health care services prevent students from receiving comprehensive sex education and accessing sexual and reproductive health care services. Below are highlights of current legislative activity related to these topics. Hawaii’s 2021 session convened on January 20, 2021.

Youth Sexual Health Data
Young people are more than their health behaviors and outcomes. While data can be a powerful tool to demonstrate the sex education and sexual health care needs of young people, it is important to be mindful that these behaviors and outcomes are impacted by systemic inequities present in our society that affect an individual’s sexual health and well-being.

Hawaii School Health Profiles Data 
In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the School Health Profiles, which measure school health policies and practices and highlight which health topics were taught in schools across the country. Since the data were collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by schools’ principals and lead health education teachers, the CDC notes that one limitation of the School Health Profiles is bias toward the reporting of more positive policies and practices. In the School Health Profiles, the CDC identifies 20 sexual health education topics as critical for ensuring a young person’s sexual health.  Below are key instruction highlights for secondary schools in Hawaii as reported for the 2017–2018 school year.
